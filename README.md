# An Open-Source PLC Firmware based on Rust and Rocket.rs

A software-defined PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) project designed to provide a modern, open-source solution for industrial automation. This project leverages the Rust programming language and the Rocket.rs web framework to deliver a robust and efficient firmware for PLC systems.

## Features

- **Analog Input/Output Management**: Retrieve and manage analog input and output data via a RESTful API.
- **Secure API Key Management**: Generate and revoke API keys for secure access.
- **Extensible Design**: Built with Rust for safety, performance, and scalability.

## API Overview

### Endpoint: Fetch Analog Inputs/Outputs

- **URL**: `GET /api/analog_inputs_outputs`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `latest=true`: Fetch the most recent data.
  - `latest=false`: Fetch all available data.
- **Response Example**:
  ```json
  {
      "id": 1,
      "analog_input_0": 3.3,
      "analog_input_1": 2.5,
      "analog_output_0": 1.2,
      "timestamp": "2025-03-31T12:00:00Z"
  }

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Rust**: Install Rust by following the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **Rocket.rs**: Ensure Rocket.rs dependencies are installed. Refer to the [Rocket.rs Getting Started Guide](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/).
3. **Node.js and npm** *(optional)*: Required if you plan to modify or build the frontend templates.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/EEP1.git
   cd EEP1
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

4. **Access the API**:
   Open your browser or API client and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Testing the API

Use the following example command to test the API:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/analog_inputs_outputs?latest=true"
```

### Frontend Development *(Optional)*

If you need to modify the frontend templates:

1. Navigate to the `Server/templates` directory.
2. Edit the HTML files as needed.
3. Restart the server to apply changes.
